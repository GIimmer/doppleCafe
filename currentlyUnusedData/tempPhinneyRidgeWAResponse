The caf\u00e9 is in a pretty new building and the d\u00e9cor is contemporary and subdued. When I visited around 3pm on a Saturday, I was one of two groups. The two ladies working were friendly and nice to talk to as well. I have kept an eye on Celine Patisserie\u2019s social media and had an idea of what I wanted. They had a lot of desserts still available when I visited. I ended up sharing a custard tart with fresh raspberries and blueberries, and then also got an earl grey croissant and raspberry mascarpone cruffin to go. The custard tart was great \u2013 it was creamy and eggy and the best part were the fresh raspberries. They were floral and bursting with flavor. They were the platonic ideal of a ripe raspberry. The earl grey croissant was great as well with a creamy earl grey filling. As I was eating the croissant, the whole thing reminded me of a cream puff with the crispy exterior and cream filled interior. The cruffin was really good too. The raspberry jam was sweet and tart which balanced well with the creamy mascarpone. Overall, I think Celine is now one of my favorite pastry places in Seattle.

Whether it\u2019s for a latte or just an herbal tea, the baristas here know exactly how to make the perfect cup of something to fill the hollows of my heart. The outdoor patio is usually vacant in the winter, which is great, because it allows me time to tune out the world, to forget about all my problems, to sip on teas and consult google maps in peace. \n\nSee, I've been on the hunt for the perfect Phinney Ridge lookout for most of the day. I\u2019ve seen it before. I\u2019ve been there many times, but the path is lost to me.\n\nIt\u2019s here somewhere.\u00a0\n\nMoments turn to minutes to hours on the hill, weaving through the narrow aves and eaves of single-lane streets, passing by all the two-to-three story multi-million dollar homes that grow less impressive with each step, fading out to background fuzz.  It\u2019s at this point, each time, that I seem to get lost. The street blur together, letters lose their meaning and signs float away. I turn left instead of right, and the crows fluttering in my wake seem to be taunting me with their caws. All I know is that Palatine A-V-E is important to me\u2014I\u2019m not sure if the place I\u2019m looking for is on Palatine, but it may be a cross-street. Or it may not. I\u2019m really not sure because, back then, I wasn't the one navigating.\u00a0\n\nIt was a gal I dated for a time. We hung out a lot, smoked cigarettes and pot, and spent most of our time wishing that we could make the other person less sad.\u00a0\n\nWe'd wander off to somewhere new, far away, any place that a bus could bring us to, take long walks through neighborhoods pretending like we belonged, like we were well-established: like there was real food in the fridge and we could leave our phones at home because we didn't need anyone else, we didn\u2019t need friends or relatives to bum a few bucks off of to help pay for heat, for electricity, for rent, we didn\u2019t need anybody and we could do it all on our own. We could just take a walk on sunny day and get lost on not being anybody, or anything.\n\nIt took a few months, but we stumbled down a dead end. It looked out over the city, the mountains, and everything in between. There was so much life sprawling out all around us, so much movement that if you unfocused your eyes you almost got a sense of something bigger heading your way. To sweep you off your feet. To lift you up. To us, it felt like a wonder, like the kind you hear about astronauts being able to see from on high up in space. This whole street knew what they had, too, because all the homes flattened into the hillside to be polite enough to let their neighbors get in on those magnificent sunsets: watch the world bleed into neon colors of lemonade and cotton-candy and oreo-cookie packaging while the clouds weaved past peaks. It was a place where rabbits chased each other across the street, where on a cloudy night the city shimmered like the stars, where the dew was ever-present, coating this slice of eden in a glossy shimmer\u2014like those close-ups of fancy dames you see in an old hollywood film. \n\nThe last few months we were together was spent up on that ridge.\u00a0\n\nWe parted ways a while back, broke up over unwashed dishes, over a fight that was long brewing, and when the words came out they rang too true to deny. When the sun came up next we were both gone, like nothing ever happened, fading back into that part of your mind where dreams go to hide.\u00a0\n\nI think I found it via satellite. I\u2019ve drawn up a map to take me there, to help me focus more on what my gut has to say rather than the caws of passing thoughts. But, right now my gut says this tea isn\u2019t sitting too well with my empty stomach. The bathroom here is clean, homey, and the walls are paper thin: not a place you want to spend too much time in\u2014if you get my meaning\u2014not with such nice baristas hanging on just the other side. \n\nIf I know my body right, I should have another half hour. Maybe forty minutes.

Had an XPA that reminded me of Half Acre's Daisy Cutter Pale Ale.\nAs for service, bartendress asked if i'd like to hear the commentary on the game. I chose to continue listening to the great music from her phone. I finished my latte and immediately found a beer in front of me. I finished that one and what's this!? Another beer! \nAtmosphere, a little hard to judge with only 3-4 patrons while I was there, but music was the perfect volume to chat and hear my phone ding on medium volume. I was able to watch the game in peace for a while, could have conversed if I wanted. Never felt rushed. Actually loved the abundant wood. A few locals came in and went while stopping to chat for a spell, which is always nice to see in a local bar. I'll definitely stop by again before I head back to Chicago.

Combining bean quality with skilled roasters and a supremely skilled bar staff leads to astoundingly good coffee. It is not hyperbole to say that Slate completely changed my view of single origin espresso. Just like any speciality coffee roaster/shop Slate can be a bit expensive, especially if you explore some of the more complex aspects of the menu; though the cost of an espresso is about on par with the majority of respectable coffee houses in Seattle.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s112074361248135256797!2s0x0:0xeee65018abe7c355?hl=en-US", "id": "17214534692563829589-1474836986.696"}, {"reviewer": "Brian", "datetime": "2016-08-15T22:59:00Z", "rating": "5", "text": "I don't want to oversell this place but it's the best coffee experience in Seattle.\n\nThat is all \ud83d\ude06\n\nExpect a quiet and intimate (that means small) coffee shop with great service and knowledge of coffee.

There are two options open to whomever you choose to be on any given day, though I only had the pleasure of visiting the one closest to the kids corner. \n\nAt first I wasn\u2019t impressed but after flushing, washing, and waiting on an EZ Bake hand dryer I was pleasantly surprised to find the door handle was missing. Maybe \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d is the wrong phrase. \n\nOver the past few months I hadn\u2019t been able to get a handle on anything, my life was slipping out from under me and I was watching it go, inch by inch, crawling towards the door. Now, there was no where to go. Just me alone in a room with my thoughts. I reached for my phone but no forums, no email, no swipe through tinder would keep me from experiencing this world and all it had to offer. \n\nFour walls. Running water. A place to sit. The bare minimum dream. Why do I feel the need for anything more?\n\nI reconsider my entire life, turning it over in my hand, looking at the slippery underbelly of what I had become. A wage slave. A petty politicker. An attention junkie looking for another fix. \n\nCredit card debt is piling and I don\u2019t have the means to buy myself a proper bed. I\u2019ve been sleeping on a couch for two months now and, though it is a wonderful and pricey couch, it is still a couch. It\u2019s the last remnants of a relationship gone sour. It\u2019s the last thing holding me down because it\u2019s the only thing I can\u2019t stuff in the back of my car to escape this progressive farce of a city. A town that calls itself green is running red with corporate buyouts and political favors in exchange for rooftop cheese tricked into taxing itself as if it will be the Hail Mary to get to the shining utopia where every citizen has an espresso in their hand, a smile on their face, and rock-climbing shoes at the back of their closet collecting dust; but all that tax money goes right out the community to let corporations bump their stock, leaving us with a string of small businesses struggling to afford doorknobs. \n\nI love what Chaco Canyon has done here: they\u2019ve left the doorknob off in protest. It\u2019s a political statement, a symbol of the oppressed! \n\nI told myself I could leave this city at any time but now I can see, truly, how trapped I am in this lifestyle. I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s dream while stuck on the sidelines wondering what went wrong. Leaving school with only a two year degree? Pursuing my art? Investing my savings in crypto currency? \n\nI was spiraling. The room joined in and whirlibirded before my eyes. How long until I\u2019ll be just like those psychopaths out there, paying out the nose for vegetables and proud of it? Ghostly Cherub feet of unborn children danced on my future grave. Am I ready to give in and let myself start an IRA: I saw the tired eyes of my father flash before me, clouded over with dreams of life after retirement. \n\nI nearly yakked. \n\nLuckily, it was at that moment a woman knocked. Are you okay? \n\n\u201cCould you open the door for me?\u201d \n\nShe obliged. \n\nI walked out of the bathroom covered in sweat, found my seat, and pretended to belong with the rest of them. My mask was so cracked I was convinced someone would notice, but nobody did. Each was caught up in their worlds, doting on the eyes of their children, whispering to each other about how long the wait is, wondering if they should take their food to go: insulated from the horrible truths of the restroom.\n\n5/5 would suffer an existential crisis here again.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s101675850637043752355!2s0x0:0x70a6d813a7d296a2?hl=en-US", "id": "8117412957313472162-1583453691.194"}, {"reviewer": "M M", "datetime": "2019-11-05T17:49:00Z", "rating": "4", "text": "Went for the first time and had an amazing time.

I opted for KBBQ pork plate, as I prefer savory dishes.  There was ample fatty pork to dig into with various pickled veg and kimchee.  The idea was to take lettuce and other leaves and make a wrap with pork, rice, veg, and a sauce that likely had ample gochujang.  The perilla leaves were this interesting bitter/herbaceous flavor giving the wrap a zing.\n\nMy wife had a salad with fried tofu, of which I had a taste.  There were ample microgreens and a tasty dressing.\n\nThe service was quite good.  The restaurant seemed over-staffed, but it didn't deter from our experience.

There's an open area, when you enter, for waiting and they also have the coffee machines there. We came for brunch on a Saturday. The wait was about 45 mins. We ordered coffee and kombucha while we waited. The staff were friendly. \n\nWe got seated at the community table which we shared with 2 other groups. The place is a little small, in that there's not a lot of seating, probably about 7-8 tables? The problem with community tables is you don't know who you will be sharing the table with. One of the groups of 2 was a little loud, and that sort of dampened our experience a little. We noticed a table for 2 had just vacated and I spoke to one of the staff members to move us there. They said there are other people waiting who will get that table. The rush was already over by this time and I didn't see anyone occupy that table until a couple of people walked in at least 5 mins later. Also, we had only been seated 5 mins ago and hadn't yet placed our order, so I felt it wasn't good customer service on their end to not let us move. \n\nWe ordered eggs benedict, mushroom poutine and a side of kimchi. Everything was decent, but nothing special. I expected a lot more. The one big positive about this place is they pay their staff well, so customers don't have to tip. But one negative is also that they don't take reservations, which is sort of understandable since they're a small establishment. But they don't even have a phone number to call and check current wait times. This would help people who are driving 20-30 mins to get here. A lot of people that came after us left immediately because the wait times had reached over an hour. They need to look into it. But I don't think I'll be coming back for food. Coffee?

The reason was a writeup in a local newspaper from the day before, so they had unexpected high number of patrons. Understandable, but no mention of whether more food will be available. I guess they were just going to be a coffee shops for the rest of the day?\n\nOn our second visit, which was just after 11am, trying to get food before lunch rush. We were told there was no food because the chef was sick. So, wait, you were just going to be a coffee shop for the whole day? How about a sign outside? You had single point of failure that crippled the entire food operation? And what about all those people in the kitchen looking busy, what were they up to?\n\nWe finally gathered enough courage for a third visit. Either we were going to submit an edit that food isn't served here, or we would finally get to taste some rumored yummy. Luckily it was the latter. The loco moco, although not bad, mostly just a strong single note of black pepper and not much else. The chicken and waffles, on the other hand, was excellent. The chicken wings had just the right amount of batter to be able to taste the meat as well. And the spiciness was right on; enough to feel the heat, but doesn't overrun the other flavors. The meat was juicy, and the waffles were crispy and light.\n\nThere is an open area when you first walk in. If you have to wait for a table, there are no places to sit. You are left to wonder outside up and down the street. It would be nice to have some chairs there; there's room. Also, no real bike rack out front. There's one a few doors down, but too far to feel comfortable in a high risk area like Ballard. A bike rack right out front would be nice. Lots of folks want to bike to places in Ballard. The only parking is in the local residential streets, not always easy to come by, making a good bike rack that much more desirable.\n\nAll in all, feels more like a restaurant that serves coffee rather than the other way around. Food shows promises, and hope things will improve.

If I counted correctly, there are only around 6-8 tables in the whole place and depending on when you get there and your party size / who got there before you; you could be waiting awhile.\n\nWe went on a Saturday morning. What doesn't look like a crowded restaurant when driving by, can actually be crowded because of the small size.\n\nWhen you get there, you can put your name in with the person at the register and order a drink if you would like. The wait time they give you was a little off in our experience but only by ~15 minutes.\n\nAt the time you finally get a table, you'll see the menu is not very large. But that isn't a bad thing in this case because there are too many good looking dishes to choose from. I ended up struggling between like 4 of them. In the end, I ordered the Fruity Pebble French Toast and the KBBQ Pork Plate. I was happy with both of my choices. The Fruity Pebble French Toast was very sweet, but what else would you be expecting when ordering a dish like that? It doesn't always come out as pretty as the picture you see on instagram though. I would be careful having that high of an expectation. For the KBBQ Pork Plate, order the veggies with it. Even though they call it a plate of veggies, it is actually a plate of leaves, different salad leaves like Romain and Perilla leaves.\n\nMy boyfriend ended up ordering the Soba. It was kinda expensive for the small portion they give you. It was yummy though if you are not paying attention to the price and the amount. The house kimchi was good as well.\n\nWith the effort it took to get here and the 45 minute wait, I am indecisive if I will be back.

Great char and flavor that elevates it past the already tasty dish. \n\nHighly recommend checking out this spot as it can be a bit inconspicuous with its location on a busy 15th Ave.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s113805108057175530654!2s0x0:0x576bc1a5a4bea6bb?hl=en-US", "id": "6299341420985493179-1551507041.11"}, {"reviewer": "Angela Bertrand", "datetime": "2019-03-02T23:01:00Z", "rating": "5", "text": "We went in with the plan to order several things and share them as a table, so we were excited to see that that was what was recommended!

If you don't plan on ordering a sandwich, the drive thru is the way to go.\n\nTheir selection of coffee and tea is ideal. First time I've seen a place offer 6oz cappuccino. (Yaaasss). Also, everything here is compostable! \n\nWe ordered the buttermilk biscuit with sausage gravy and their fast break sandwich on a bourbon ghost pepper biscuit.

It's very small and gets a lot of traffic since it's right by the metro.  There is not enough space for people waiting for their drinks so you have to maneuver through the waiting crowd just to get in line.  Most of the people working there look like they hate their jobs.  There was this one nice barista that was the exception but he left a while ago.  I still go because it's the closest one to my office but I just get regular brewed coffee.

My Spanish students and I tried to get a reservation with them for 8 people and at the end I had to stop by to talk to them in person. Once there, I was simply denied the option because they needed more time in advance for them to plan having a group in their business. When I told them that we have been trying to reach them for almost a week, their response was: well, we are a small business and we are very busy! What? They did not seem interested at all in having people over spending money in their business, let alone offer an alternative or other option i.e., maybe come with the group at a different time, different day, etc. NOTHING! I was shocked at the lack of interest and poor customer service these people had. So please, do not be surprised if they treat you badly if you dare to stop by and you are not one of these two: 1) an American student learning Spanish or 2) an European Spanish (I am a latina and could feel how the waitress did not even try to be welcoming to us as soon as she heard my accent, even if my husband was with me and is actually from SPAIN).

I honestly love that it's \"No English\"- just makes it so much fun and really highlights the purpose. The United States is now the second country with the most Spanish speakers after Mexico and is an extremely important language in the states. You can see it's popularity in recent music, Spanish translations on signs everywhere, etc.. I have no doubts that it could one day be declared the 2nd official language in the states.

As well, I liked all the previous baristas who use to work here and thought they were very friendly and always made good drinks.  However, there is a new barista working here and she is utterly hostile and condescending.  The moment I walked in to order my drink she started snapping at me and acting in a very passive aggressive manner.  I'm feeling she is discriminating me possibly because of my gender or maybe she hates that I was friends with the other baristas here.  I notice she had a \"Girl Power\" shirt and seems to have a gender bias about her.  Obviously, she did not outright insult me for being who I am.   However, being a minority (Jewish), I have felt my share of discrimination in the past, so I tend to have a good feeling when someone is being discriminating towards me.   I felt like she hated me.

A couple of lower tables adorn the front side of the shop. There's a small, outdoor patio with a variety of planters along a nice, wooden fence.\n\nCoffee served here is from Olympia Coffee Roasting Company, which can be on the bitter / acidic side. I got a 12 oz. Americano and doused it in half & half, as I usually do, which made it somewhat bearable. \n\nAlong the coffee bar, there's an all-glass container with a few bakery selections: a cinnamon bun with cream cheese on top, croissants, carrot bread, ham & cheese scones, muffins, and cookies. I had a croissant, which was exactly what I expected it to be ... light, buttery, and tasty.\n\nService was moderately friendly, but not what I'd consider \"outgoing\" either, perhaps because I'm not a recognizable regular.\n\nThe wifi password is clearly taped onto the register for patrons to consume. This isn't always done at coffee shops, and it's annoying to have to ask for it. I lucked out and had Xfinity wifi immediately available to me close by.\n\nAll in all, this is a top-notch location.
